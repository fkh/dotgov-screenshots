# .gov screenshots
This little app grabs screenshots of [.gov domains](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/18/a-complete-list-of-gov-domains/)
using [Pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres). To run it, clone the
repository and run the following:

```sh
$ npm install       # install dependencies
$ npm run capture   # take some screenshots
```

This will take some time.
